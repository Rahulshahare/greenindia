  The idea behind developing GreenIndia site is that,
  in upcomming jully maharastra govt is going to plant
  2cr plants for better envirnment. 
  Yes ofcourse everyone will be interesting for helping in plantion of those trees. 
  but after planting those trees who gonna take care of it. 
  if somebody taking care of planted trees how we gonna know about it. because we cnt visit every tree for 
  checking its growth. 
  the prblm is to measure the actual growth of those trees across the state or country. 
  and with the help of computer science we can have a solution for it. this solition will actully engage the ppls 
  for protecting and growing the tree. 

  the idea is a login system for every user and a posting box with images and some text. 

  simply a small social network but this will usefull only for managing the trees. 

  if we implimented this model then will can measure the actual growth of any tree planted from anywhere. 
  we can think about how trees are growing, how ppls are taking part in protecting the tree, or even watering the tree. 
  or any other problems if arrise. 
  any time, from anywhere and anyone can see the growth in planted trees and the participation of ppls. 

  so user have to create free account on site. 
  then he/she have to plant a tree, 
  for creating a tree in user account the some information will need and it will be 
    -- location of tree (includes state/district/city)
    -- the kind of tree/ Name of tree
    -- Plantation Date 
    -- and the idea is to create unique name for tree like username
    -- GPS co-rodinated (if provided)
    -- some details about tree
